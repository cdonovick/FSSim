So there are 5 params. 

i - for instructions total lines written 
rw - for number of those that are reads/writes to files that allready exist. 
    I didnt differentiate becuase I did not think it mattered. 
s - size of the average file
r -range of the average 
    I do size +/- rand()%range.
l - locality, basically touch.
